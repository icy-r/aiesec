                    Benchmark 3.0 is a three-stage event aimed at advancing skills in
                    UI/UX design. It starts with a hands-on bootcamp, followed by a
                    hackathon where teams compete to create innovative UI/UX designs
                    according to the given challenge. The event wraps up with a
                    prototyping competition, where participants turn their designs into
                    functional prototypes, demonstrating their ability to bring ideas to
                    life.
